# Changes Implemented

## Summary
Three UI/UX improvements have been implemented based on user requirements:

---

## 1. ✅ Fixed Score Alignment in Email Template

**Issue:** The score was not properly centered in the circular badge in the email template.

**Solution:** Updated the email template to use a more email-client-compatible centering method using `display: table` and `table-cell` with `vertical-align: middle`.

**Files Modified:**
- `email_service.py` (lines 73-82)

**Changes:**
- Replaced flexbox layout with table-cell display method
- Added `line-height: 120px` for better vertical centering
- Wrapped score text in a `<span>` element with proper styling

---

## 2. ✅ Added Student ID Column and Comment Field

**Issue:** The preview table needed to display student IDs and allow adding comments for each student.

**Solution:** 
- Added `comment` field to the Student database model
- Created API endpoint to update student comments
- Modified preview table to show student ID and editable comment field

**Files Modified:**
- `models.py`:
  - Added `comment = db.Column(db.Text)` to Student model (line 17)
  - Updated `to_dict()` method to include comment field (line 30)
  - Added new API endpoint `/api/students/<id>/comment` (lines 717-740)

- `templates/preview.html`:
  - Added "ID" column header (line 113)
  - Added "Comment" column header (line 125)
  - Updated table colspan from 7 to 9 (lines 131, 198)
  - Added student ID display in table rows (line 207)
  - Added editable comment input field (lines 217-223)
  - Added `updateComment()` JavaScript function (lines 412-437)

**Features:**
- Student ID is now visible in the preview table
- Comment field allows inline editing
- Comments are automatically saved when you click outside the input field (onblur event)
- Success/error toast notifications for comment updates
- Comments are stored in the database and persist across sessions

**Database Migration:**
- Created `migrate_add_comment.py` script to add the comment column to existing databases
- Run `python migrate_add_comment.py` to update your database

**Sample Files Updated:**
- `sample_data.csv` - Now includes student_id and comment columns with example data
- `sample_students.csv` - Now includes student_id and comment columns with example data
- `templates/index.html` - Updated example table to show new columns
- Updated file format instructions to list student_id and comment as optional columns

**Backend Updates:**
- Modified upload processing to accept student_id and comment as optional columns
- Updated column mapping function to handle new optional fields
- Modified save_students function to store student_id and comment data

## 3. ✅ Removed "Ask a Question" Form

**Issue:** The "Ask a Question" form was not needed in the help page.

**Solution:** Removed the entire "Ask a Question" section from the help page, including both HTML and JavaScript code.

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/help.html`:
  - Removed "Ask a Question" HTML section (lines 14-31)
  - Removed `askQuestion()` JavaScript function (lines 249-280)
  - Removed event listeners for the ask button (lines 282-285)

**Result:** The help page now shows only the documentation content without the question form.

# üìÅ File Upload Format Guide

## Quick Start

### ‚úÖ What You Need
**Only 1 column is required**: `email`

**Everything else is optional!**

---

## üìä Upload ANY Format You Want

The system is **completely flexible**. You can upload files with ANY columns, and they will ALL appear in the email table.

### Example 1: Minimal Format
```csv
email
student1@example.com
student2@example.com
```

### Example 2: Basic Format
```csv
name,email,score
John Doe,john@example.com,85
Jane Smith,jane@example.com,92
```

### Example 3: Your Current Format
```csv
first name,last name,id,class,email,hw1,participation,q1,final khmer,final english,total,grade,comments
John,Doe,2001,CS101,john@example.com,85,90,88,92,89,88.8,A,Excellent work
Jane,Smith,2002,CS101,jane@example.com,78,85,82,80,85,82.0,B+,Good progress
```

### Example 4: Custom Format
```csv
email,quiz1,quiz2,quiz3,midterm,final,project,attendance,total,grade,teacher_notes
john@example.com,80,85,90,88,92,95,100,89.5,A,Outstanding student
jane@example.com,75,80,85,82,88,90,95,85.2,B+,Very good work

## üéØ How It Works

### 1. Column Recognition
The system automatically recognizes these standard columns:
- `email` ‚Üê **REQUIRED**
- `name` or `first name` + `last name`
- `score` or `total`
- `id` or `student_id`
- `class` or `batch`
- `subject`
- `comment` or `comments`

### 2. Extra Columns
**ANY other columns** you add will:
- ‚úÖ Be stored in the database
- ‚úÖ Appear in the email table
- ‚úÖ Display in the SAME ORDER as your file
- ‚úÖ Be preserved for future use

### 3. Column Order
The email table will show columns in the **exact same order** as your CSV file (excluding email, which is used for sending).

**Your CSV**:
```
first name, last name, id, class, hw1, total, grade
```

**Email Table**:
```
FIRST NAME | LAST NAME | ID | CLASS | HW1 | TOTAL | GRADE
```

```

## üé® Email Table Styling

### Highlighted Columns
These columns get special highlighting (yellow background):
- `total`
- `grade`
- `score`

### All Other Columns
- Display with normal styling
- Still included in the table
- Easy to read and scan

---

## üöÄ Best Practices

### 1. Organize Your Columns
Put columns in the order you want students to see them:
```csv
email,name,class,hw1,hw2,quiz1,quiz2,midterm,final,total,grade,comments
```

### 2. Use Clear Column Names
- Use descriptive names: `Homework 1` instead of `HW1`
- Or use short codes: `HW1`, `Q1`, `MT` (they'll be capitalized in emails)

### 3. Include Comments
- Add a `comments` column for personalized feedback
- Or add comments later in the app

### 4. Test First
- Upload a small test file first
- Send a test email to yourself
- Verify the format looks good
- Then upload the full file

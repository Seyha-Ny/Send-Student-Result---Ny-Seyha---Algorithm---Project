# ✅ Automatic Column Mapping - ENABLED

## 🎉 Your App Now Accepts Files with Different Column Names!

Your app will **automatically** handle files with columns like:
- `first name`, `last name`, `id`, `class`, `email`, `hw1`, `participation`, `q1`, `final khmer`, `final english`, `total`, `grade`, `comments`

## 🔄 Automatic Transformations

The app automatically performs these mappings:

### 1. **Name Field**
- `first name` + `last name` → Combined into `name`
- `firstname` + `lastname` → Combined into `name`
- Example: "John" + "Doe" → "John Doe"

### 2. **Score Field**
- `total` → `score`
- `total score` → `score`
- `final score` → `score`
- `marks` → `score`
- `total marks` → `score`

### 3. **Student ID Field**
- `id` → `student_id`

### 4. **Batch/Class Field**
- `class` → `batch`

### 5. **Comments Field**
- `comments` → `comment`

## 📊 Example Transformation

**Your File (Before):**
```
first name | last name | id   | class  | email              | total | comments
John       | Doe       | 2001 | CS101  | john@example.com   | 88.8  | Good work
```

**After Auto-Mapping:**
```
name      | email              | score | student_id | batch | comment
John Doe  | john@example.com   | 88.8  | 2001       | CS101 | Good work
```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Upload your file** with any of the supported column names
2. **App automatically maps** the columns
3. **Data is processed** and saved
4. **No manual editing needed!**

## ✅ Supported File Formats

Your file can have columns in any order with these names:
- ✅ `first name`, `last name` (will be combined)
- ✅ `id` (mapped to student_id)
- ✅ `class` (mapped to batch)
- ✅ `email` (must be present)
- ✅ `total` (mapped to score)
- ✅ `comments` (mapped to comment)
- ✅ Any other columns (automatically removed)

## 🧪 Test File

A test file `test_upload.csv` has been created with your exact column structure. Try uploading it!

## 📝 Console Logs

When you upload a file, check the server console to see the automatic mappings:
```
File columns: ['first name', 'last name', 'id', 'class', 'email', 'hw1', 'total', ...]
Combined 'first name' and 'last name' into 'name'
Mapped 'total' to 'score'
Mapped 'id' to 'student_id'
Mapped 'class' to 'batch'
Mapped 'comments' to 'comment'
Columns after auto-mapping: ['name', 'email', 'score', 'student_id', 'batch', 'comment', ...]
```

## 🎯 No More Errors!
